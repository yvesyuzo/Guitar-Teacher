### Project Title
Guitar Teacher

### Description
Final project from Software Desgin subject at Insper Engineering course
  - This program is made to teach a user to play guitar
  - The original intent was to show the notes in a similar fashion than Guitar Hero and by recording the sound 
    be able to tell if it was the correct note.
  - But we were only able to finish the sound recognition so it works more like a guitar tuner.
  - The program has a graphical interface that requires mic access to record and analise frequencies played
  - Similar to guitar tuner apps it shows which note you have played
